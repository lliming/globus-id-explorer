             <h2>Correcting your identity data</h2>

             <p>{{pagetitle}} obtains identity data from Globus. Globus obtains identity data
                from the organizations you've logged in with or have linked in Globus. These
                organizations are called <i>identity providers</i>.</p>

             <p class="data">When you visited {{pagetitle}}, your effective identity 
                provider was <b class="data">{{primaryidp}}</b>. Globus will always use the same effective
                identity provider for this app, but other apps may request a different effective identity
                provider.</p>

             <p>Your name, email address, and username come from this identity provider. (Your organization 
                might also.) To correct this data, visit the website for the identity provider 
                above, find your user profile, and make your changes there. The next time you authenticate
                using that identity provider in any app that uses Globus, the data will be updated in Globus.</p>

             <p class="note"><b>Note regarding ACCESS apps:</b> ACCESS apps request ACCESS CI as the effective 
                identity provider. When you use ACCESS apps, your name, email address, username, and 
                organization come from your ACCESS user profile.</p>
